**SENSEI software: Smart Water Networks Using Artificial Intelligence**

***RELEASE of the first version COMING SOON!*** ðŸš€

The **main objectives** of this methodology are:

 i) To provide appropriate mathematical **programming methodologies based on artificial intelligence techniques** 
 
ii) a set of tools gathered in an open-source sotfware, which **facilitate water utilities worldwide** undergoing a digital transformation, big data and AI algorithms. 

With access to **big data, AI algorithms should provide** the following functionalities:

â€¢ **Optimal design** of monitoring and control networks

â€¢ Numerical **detection** of physical and apparent **water losses**

â€¢ **Energy savings**

â€¢ Definition of **contingency plans and protocols**

â€¢ Classification of consumption patterns and **demand forecasting**

â€¢ **Network expansion** design with **optimal configuration**
